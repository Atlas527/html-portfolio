<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hello, my name is Nik. I'm a father of 6 children consisting of 4 girls and 2 boys (yes I have grey hair already). I'm new to coding and programming at the time of creating this page, but I'm excited to see where it goes and how far I can take it. </p>

<p>My previous professional work has all involved manufacturing and quality control, so moving towards a digital environment is completely new to me. Of course I used computers in my previous positions but none of them were entirely computer based.</p>

<p>As I watch my chilcren grow every day it encourages me more to become a developer or programmer. I'm learning all of this on my own and I want to be able to look back one day and say that I made it. I did it for my family.</p>
